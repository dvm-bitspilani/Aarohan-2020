        WISSENOVA
    </h1>
    <h2>
        " The analysis of concepts is for understanding nothing more than what the magnifying glass is for sight."
    </h2>
    <p>
        Looking for something that puts to test your understanding of all those scientific principles you've been
        learning all your life? That not only intrigues and challenges you with brand new content on recent scientific
        discoveries but also continuously checks your ability to implement them?
    </p>
    <p>
        Psych yourselves up, as this right here
        is your opportunity to achieve all of that- Aarohan Wissenova!
    </p>
    <h2>What is AAROHAN Wissenova?</h2>
    <p>
        'Aarohan Wissenova' is an online competition which will be held as series of monthly contests, each contest
        being independent of the other. The winners of each monthly contest compete in another application and IQ based
        Round at the end, and the ultimate winners of the competition get a wild card entry into the Round 2 of Aarohan,
        conducted during our technical fest, APOGEE!
    </p>
    <h2>
        Why conduct an online competition?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Team Aarohan came up with this idea of conducting a series of online contests to be able to reach out to a
        larger number of enthusiast students sitting at their home. Through Aarohan Wissenova, we aim to provide all of
        them with a way to channelise their knowledge, thoughts and ideas in a productive manner. A lot of us are hooked
        to Instagram and Facebook when we enter our teens, so why not provide more avenues to be hooked to it for the
        right reasons?
    </p>
    <h2>Why 'Wissenova'?</h2>
    <p>
        Wissenova:<br> / <i>German</i> /<br>innovative knowledge
    </p>
    <p>
        While Aarohan means Ascent in Sanskrit, Wissenova is German for
        Innovative Knowledge. Put the two together, and here is your way to ascent towards new, innovative knowledge, a
        way that fulfills your passion for deep understanding and testing of the concepts you've been learning all your
        life!
    </p>
    <p>
        Be sure to look out for some really cool content on recent scientific discoveries and developments, which
        will be based on a different theme every month.
    </p>
